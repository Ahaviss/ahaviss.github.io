        <h2>Main Info</h2>
        <p> Cricket is a game played with a bat and ball. There are 2 teams each with 11 players. There are 3 types of players. An batter, an bowler and an all-rounder. The bowler bowls the ball to the batter. The batter tries to hit the ball as far as he can. An all-rounder is a batter and bowler combined. Each team's objective is to score the most runs. The team that is batting is trying to hit runs or reach the target amount of runs set by the bowling team. The bowling team is trying to restrict them from hitting a lot of runs or they are trying to stop them from hitting the target amount of runs that they set. Also, the bowling team is trying to hit the wickets which are three stumps behind the batter. Whoever scores the most runs wins!</p>

       <h2>Bowling</h2> 
        <p>There are mainly two types of bowlers, fast and spin             bowlers. Fast bowlers are bowlers which bowl with speed and         pace. In fast bowlers, there are two types of bowling styles         , swing and seam. Swing bowlers make the bal either swing in         the sir or swing on impact. This is caused when the bowler          makes one side of the ball shine and the other side rough so         the air current curls around the shiny/clean side which             makes the ball go the other way. Seam bowlers change the            ball's angle as there is a dividing line so when that               dividing line if facing the left, it goes to the left and           when faced to the right, it goes to the right. Spin bowlers         use something called side-spin which is when a bowlers spins         the ball in one direction and the ball goes the way                 it was spinned due to friction. </p>

          <h2>Batting</h2>  
          <p>
        While batting, you need to be               precise and you need to time your           shots. You also need hand-eye               coordination so that you don't miss         the ball and possibly give away a           wicket. As a batter, you have to            adapt to various playing condition          and also you need to adapt to the           pitch. Keep in mind that batting in         Cricket is all about hand-eye               coordination, timing, power, and            preciseness.
